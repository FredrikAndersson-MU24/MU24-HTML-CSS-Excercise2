        <p>
          Since becoming a father I've read many childrens books. I believe it
          is a key part of a childs development in terms of their ability to
          learn how to read themselves and expand their vocabulary. It is also a
          perfect way to just spend some time together, and share a peaceful
          moment.
          <br />But only in the last couple of years I've discovered the
          pleasure of reading novels for myself, something I have not
          appreciated at all in the past. I now find that reading instead of
          endlessly swiping on my phone right before I go to bed really improves
          the quality of my sleep. It is also a great escape from digital media
          for a while...

          With all the benefits it brings I hope I can maintain the habit of
