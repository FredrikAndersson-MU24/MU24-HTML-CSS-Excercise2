      <p>
        Since becoming a father I've read many childrens books. I believe it is
        a key part of a childs development in terms of their ability to learn
        how to read themselves and expand their vocabulary. It is also a perfect
        way to just spend some time together, and have a peaceful moment.
        <br />But only in the last couple of years I've discovered the pleasure
        of reading novels for myself, something I have not appreciated at all in
        the past. I now find that reading instead of swiping on my phone right
        before I go to bed really improves the quality of my sleep.
