        Through my life I have not been a fan of reading books. Since becoming a
        father I've read many childrens books. I believe it is a key part of a
        childs development in terms of the ability to read and expand their
        vocabulary.
        <br />Only in the last couple of years I've discovered the pleasure of
        reading novels for myself. I now find that reading instead of swiping
        endlessly on my phone right before I go to bed really improves the
        quality of my sleep.
